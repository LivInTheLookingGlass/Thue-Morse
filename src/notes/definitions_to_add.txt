5. Relation to Cantor Set

The Thue-Morse sequence can be linked to the Cantor set through a representation of its points. The Cantor set is constructed by repeatedly removing the middle third of intervals. The sequence T(n)T(n) can be thought of as representing the presence or absence of points at certain levels of this construction:

    Each T(n) corresponds to whether the nth interval of the Cantor set contains a point.
    The sequence can be defined such that T(n)=1 if the point is included in the Cantor set at the nth iteration, and T(n)=0 otherwise.

11. Connection to Tilings

The Thue-Morse sequence can also be associated with aperiodic tilings. An example is the domino tiling, where the sequence describes the arrangement of tiles in a non-repeating pattern. The Thue-Morse sequence can generate a substitution tiling:

    Tiles can be placed according to rules derived from the sequence. For instance, placing a tile according to whether T(n)=0 or T(n)=1 could dictate different orientations or types of tiles in a geometric arrangement.
