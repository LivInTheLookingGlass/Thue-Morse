abstract="We discuss a well-known binary sequence called the Thue-Morse sequence, or the Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence. This sequence was introduced by Thue in 1906 and rediscovered by Morse in 1921. However, it was already implicit in an 1851 paper of Prouhet. The Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence appears to be somewhat ubiquitous, and we describe many of its apparently unrelated occurrences.",

            SymPy is an open source computer algebra system written in pure Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provide additional examples and further outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.
