abstract="We discuss a well-known binary sequence called the Thue-Morse sequence, or the Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence. This sequence was introduced by Thue in 1906 and rediscovered by Morse in 1921. However, it was already implicit in an 1851 paper of Prouhet. The Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence appears to be somewhat ubiquitous, and we describe many of its apparently unrelated occurrences.",
